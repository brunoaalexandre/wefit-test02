# About this project

This project was made for the WeFit Test. <br /><br />
It's a simple project where users will can register your tasks and remove them. <br/><br />
In the project I found some challenges, such as use a fake api or save in local storage. But I choose to save in local storage, because it will stay until
the user delete it. Instead of using the fake api that would change the data when updating the page.<br /> <br />
So, that's all, folks! ‚ù§Ô∏è
